This was the Project 3 of my FullStack course.
This is 1/2 of the finished product and has only Rest Api side.
Next project will be adding front end with react.
I could have had more paths but I am a busy woman and didn't have time to make extra... except the  .patch path. Gave some extra love to that and I am quite proud.
The given grade depends on the score and the score is set to be random. Also the time is current timestamp. 

I used MongoDBs default database "Restaurants" in this app.
Remind me to switch my password after this project is graded.
